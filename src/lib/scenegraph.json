Field interpolators are generally used as children of an Animation node. As the animation progresses, it sets the fraction field of its field interpolators to a value between 0 and 1, indicating the percentage of the Animation's progress. The keyframes of the interpolator include a \"key\", the percentage where the keyframe should occur, and a \"keyValue\", the value that the field should have at that percentage.\nFor example, if a FloatFieldInterpolator had three keyframes, (0.0, 10.0), (0.4, 200.0) and (1.0, 87.0), then when the interpolator's fraction field was 0.0 (i.e. 0%), the field would be set to 10.0. When fraction was 0.4 (i.e. 40%), the field would be set to 200.0. When fraction was 1.0 (i.e. 100%), the field would be set to 87.0.\nFor values of fraction between 0.0 and 0.4 (e.g. 0.2 or 20%), the field value is determined by linearly interpolating the keyValues for the first two keyframes. In this case, since the key of 0.2 is halfway between the key at 0.0 and the key at 0.4, the field would be set to 10.0 + 0.5 * (10.0 + 200.0) = 105.0. Similarly, when fraction is between the second and third keys (i.e. between 0.4 and 1.0), the field value is determined by linearly interpolating the keyValues of the second and third keyframes.\nIf the first keyframe has a key percentage greater than zero, then the field value will be equal to the keyValue of the first keyframe until fraction reaches the first keyframe's key percentage. Similarly, if the last keyframe has a key percentage less than one, the field value will be set to the keyValue of the last keyframe from when fraction equals the the last keyframe's key percentage and will not change as fraction increases from that value to 1.0.\nWhile linearly interpolation is used to compute the keyValue's for fraction values between successive keys, non-linear easing functions may be applied to the fraction values computed by the Animation node, so the overall animation may vary in speed.",

The KeyboardDialog node class includes an interrnal Keyboard node to allow the user to enter the string.\nThe KeyboardDialog allows you to add a title (by setting the Dialog title field), a help message (by setting the Dialog message field), and a set of action buttons (by setting the Dialog node buttons field). The bulletText and graphicUrl fields of the Dialog node should not be set. If those Dialog node fields are set, the layout of the dialog will likely not look correct.\nAlso, the KeyboardDialog node class inherits the behavior of the interrnal Keyboard node when the Options remote key is pressed. The Keyboard node class toggles between uppercase and lowercase letters when the Options remote key is pressed, to speed the entry of mixed-case strings by the user. Therefore, the optionsDialog field of the Dialog node class should not be set to true.\nTypically, you will want to set the KeyboardDialog node title field to prompt the user to enter the string, and add \"OK\" and \"Cancel\" buttons by setting the Dialog node buttons field to \"OK\", \"Cancel\", then observe the Dialog node class buttonSelected field to react when the user presses one of those buttons. At any time, the text field can be accessed to obtain the string entered by the user.\nAnother typical usage of the KeyboardDialog node class adds a \"Hide Text\" button, with an observer function set up to toggle the secureMode field of the Keyboard node internal TextEditBox node (that is, by toggling the value of the keyboard.textEditBox.secureMode field).",

            "description": "The TargetGroup node class associates a set of rectangular regions that children of the group will occupy. Like MarkupList, the TargetGroup has a content field containing the data for each item and an itemComponentName field that specifies an RSG component that will be used to render a content item. It also has a targetSet field that contains a TargetSet that define a set of rectangular targets where children of the TargetGroup will be rendered.\nThe TargetGroup node is typically used to create a scrolling list (or row) of items where the focused item occupies more space than the other items.\nFor example, a TargetGroup could be used to create a full screen vertical scrolling list of item where the focused item is larger than the other items in the list. As the list items scroll, the appearance of the item moving into the focus region would be dynamically adjusted to fill the larger focus region. Simultaneously, the appearance of the item leaving the focus region would be dynamically adjust to return to the unfocused size. To set up this use case, you might set the targetSet field to a TargetSet node that specifies nine rectangles. The first rectangle would be specified to have the width and height of an unfocused item and be positioned so that it's bottom is above the top of the screen. The last rectangle would be specified to have the width and height of an unfocused item and be positioned so that's top is below the bottom of the screen. The remaining seven rectangles would define the rectangular regions of the onscreen items. Suppose the design calls for the focus item to be centered vertically at the center of the screen. To do that, you would specify the 5th rectangle to be larger than the other eight and position it so that it is centered vertically, you would specify the remaining rectangles to form a column of rectangular regions where the top three and bottom three visible items would be located.\nThe second step of setting up this use case would be to implement an RSG component that will be used to render each item.  The TargetGroup node manages the creation of the items for the visible components, associates each with a ContentNode, and updates fields of the item component with information such as the current width and height of the item and the focus status of the item.\nThe TargetGroup's jumpToItem field is set to identify which content item is to be located at the TargetSet's targetRects field target rectangle identified by the TargetSet's focusindex field.\nThe final step of setting up this use case would be to create a VerticalList component that extends TargetGroup, sets up the TargetGroup's TargetSet node, and as the user presses up and down buttons on the remote, sets the TargetGroup's animateToTargetItem field to the prior or next index. Setting the animateToTargetItem field causes the displayed items to smoothly animate from their current target region to another target region, such that the specified index ends up at the TargetSet's target rectangle that is identified by the TargetSet's focusIndex field.\nThe above use case specifies the most common use case for the TargetGroup node, but only hints at the possible uses. For example, you could create your own RSG components with various custom behaviors. There might include:\nA list where all the items are small when the list does not have the focus, but when the list receives the focus, all of the items smoothly adjust their size and position so that the focus item is largest, the items on either side of the focus item are slightly larger than the unfocused size and the remaining items remain the same size as the unfocused items. To do this, you would create two TargetSet's in your RSG component, one that defines the regions when the list is unfocused and one that defines the regions when the list is focused. Initially, the TargetGroup's targetSet field would be set to the unfocused TargetSet node. Then, when the list is focused, the targetSet's animateToTargetSet field would be set to the focused TargetSet node, causing all of the target regions to smoothly animate to their new size and position, taking along the associated item component's with them.\n\nA horizontal scrolling list of items where the focused region floats across the screen as the user presses left/right until the focus region reaches the edge of the display, at which point the focus region remains stationary and the items scroll left or right. This would require the use of several TargetSet nodes (one for each possible position of the focus region). Initally, the TargetGroup's targetSet field would be set to one of these TargetSet's. Then while the focus region is not at one of the edges, key presses would set the animateToTargetSet field to animate the focus region to its next location. Once the focus region reaches an edge, another key press in the same direction would set the animateToTargetIndex field to cause the items to scroll so that the next content item occupies the focus region.\n\nA list where when an item is selected, all of the items fly off the screen while the selected item zooms up and moves to the center of the screen. To set up this use case, you would specify a TargetSet for when the list items are onscreen and another TargetSet for the onscreen location of the focused item and the offscreen locations where each items will disappear.\n\nA circular arrangement of a fixed number of items with the item at the 6 o'clock position being larger and having the focus. Note that in this case, no offscreen targets would be specified.",

            "description": "The ContentNode node class allows you to specify the data used to configure a node or component. Many nodes and components require a ContentNode node as the specification of their content field in order to be properly configured. In general, lists, grids, and panels require a ContentNode node for configuration. The data included in a ContentNode node can be data such as the text for labels in the node or component, and the spacing between items in a list, grid, or panel, including data to create custom lists, grids, and panels. The reference information for every node or component that requires a ContentNode node includes a section that details the requirements of the ContentNode node for that node or component.\nContentNode nodes defined as the specification for a node or component content field are typically structured as one ContentNode parent node, with a hierarchy of child nodes that specify the actual data, and sections of data if needed. For example, a LabelList node can have several sections that divide the entire list, each with their own section heading, and specific items in that section of the list. The ContentNode node for that LabelList node should have two levels of child ContentNode nodes, one level for the data to configure the list sections, and then another level of child ContentNode nodes for the data for each item in that list section.\nA ContentNode node can also be used to specify the data for custom components with defined interfaces, and for nodes and components that require Content Meta-Data. Also, you should use a ContentNode node for complex structures of data for your application rather than associative arrays. ContentNode node objects are passed by reference in the application, while associative array objects are copied. For large complex data structures, passing ContentNode node objects is much quicker than passing the equivalent associative array object. You can use associative arrays for simpler data structures with just a few fixed members.\nAll of the attributes listed in Content Meta-Data can be set as fields in a Content node. However, when creating a Content node, the fields themselves are not created until the valid attributes are set as fields, using either assignment (=), or set using setField() or setFields()",

For an animation to take effect, an Animation node definition must include a child field interpolator node (FloatFieldInterpolator, Vector2DFieldInterpolator, ColorFieldInterpolator) definition for each renderable node field that is animated.\nThe Animation node class provides a simple linear interpolator function, where the animation takes place smoothly and simply from beginning to end. The Animation node class also provides several more complex interpolator functions to allow custom animation effects. For example, you can move a graphic image around the screen at differing speeds and curved trajectories at different times in the animation by specifying the appropriate function in the easeFunction field (quadratic and exponential are two examples of functions that can be specified). The interpolator functions are divided into two parts: the beginning of the animation (ease-in), and the end of the animation (ease-out). You can apply a specified interpolator function to either or both ease-in and ease-out, or specify no function for either or both (which is the linear function). You can also change the portion of the animation that is ease-in and ease-out to arbitrary fractional values for a quadratic interpolator function applied to both ease-in and ease-out.",

            "description": "The Task node class allows you to specify a function to be spawned in a different thread, and run asynchronously with respect to both the scene rendering thread and the main application thread. A Task node also allows you to run functions that cannot be run in SceneGraph node or component, typically BrightScript code functions involving operations such as reading data from servers and file system manipulation. (You also cannot, and should not, run functions in a SceneGraph application for operations that are functionally the same as SceneGraph nodes and components, such as playing videos.) A list of all the BrightScript functions and components that cannot be used in SceneGraph applications or can only be used in a Task node can be found in BrightScript Support.\nA Task node is typically used to read data from a server to create a ContentNode node to configure a SceneGraph node or component (see ContentNode). A Task node used for this purpose can be thought of as a content reader. Since ContentNode nodes are required to configure many components rendered in a scene, such as lists, panels, and grids, and you will generally want to read the data for those types of nodes from your server, you should create a Task node as a content reader for each of those components that you use in your scene.\nThe Task node class was designed with three general development use cases:\nA new Task node object is created for each asynchronous operation. The input data needed for the operation is set in the Task node object <interface\\> fields in the render thread, along with an observer of the output  field data, and the Task node control field is set to RUN. After the output data is returned to the render thread, the Task node object is not used again.\n\nA Task node object is used multiple times for several identical asynchronous operations. In this case, the input data for each operation is set in the existing Task node object, with another observer for the output  field data, and the Task node control field is again set to RUN. This may be more efficient than creating a new Task node object for each of the identical operations.\n\nA Task node observes its input  fields using the port form of the ifSGNodeField observeField\\(\\) method, and returns output data with each field change. In this case, the Task node acts like a continuous server.\nSince Task nodes launch asynchronous threads, and have no provisions for locks and mutexes, you must be careful to avoid race, deadlock, and other asynchronous thread errors. Here are a few tips for using Task nodes:\nAvoid accessing files which must be persistent before thread completion, to avoid a subsequent Task node or other thread access of the same file before the thread completes. It is easier and safer to use a dynamically-created string or other data object to hold temporary thread data to avoid having a subsequent or existing thread overwrite and corrupt the data.\n\nBe very careful if you access any object in a Task node that may exist in another thread. It is better to completely separate all objects in any other possible thread from the Task node thread by setting the  fields of the Task node with copies of the minimum amount of data needed to run the thread.\n\nIn the Task node init() function, perform the minimum required amount of initialization of the Task node and any included thread functions. If you intend to trigger an asynchronous task based on a Task node input  field change, in many cases, you should only set up the observer for the field in init().\n\nUse the port form of the ifSGNodeField observeField\\(\\) rather than the onChange attribute. This will avoid triggering the thread in response to a render thread event before the Task node observers are set up.\n\nIt is more efficient to use a persistent Task node that is triggered by an  field change than to create a new Task node every time a particular asynchronous thread is required. If needed, you can communicate that the particular asynchronous thread is no longer required through an  field as well, either through the triggering field, or a special field used for control of the Task node.\n\nYou can use a single Task node object to run any number of different asynchronous threads by setting the functionName field to the Task node function you want before setting the control field to RUN. If you do not use the input data  fields to trigger running the thread, this is equivalent to calling an asynchronous function, and passing the input data fields as arguments to the function. The output data  fields can likewise be considered as the return value of a asynchronous function call, but to avoid blocking you must observe the fields, or the state field, as a callback event to handle the results in the calling thread.\nAlso review SceneGraph Threads for in-depth information on using Task nodes most efficiently.",

            "description": "The MaskGroup node class allows an alpha mask bitmap to be applied to the rendering of its children. This allows effects such as having a list fade out at the bottom to be easily created.\nMaskGroup nodes do not work on all Roku players (specifically, MaskGroup nodes only work on players that support OpenGL). On players whose graphics do not support OpenGL, a MaskGroup node just renders its children without applying the extra alpha mask. For this reason, you should avoid using the MaskGroup node for anything other than decorative purposes, such as creating a fading effect at the bottom of the screen, where the user interface information value of the screen element is not affected by the lack of the MaskNode node rendering.\nUnlike other bitmaps, the MaskGroup node class does not work with 9-patch images. If the bitmap size does not match the group bounding rectangle, the edge rows of the mask are repeated as needed.\nFor example, suppose the MaskGroup node bounding rectangle has an origin at (0, 0), a width of 150 and a height of 80. If the mask bitmap were also 150 by 80, and the maskOffset and maskSize field values were left at their default values of 0, 0, then each pixel of the mask bitmap would be applied to the corresponding pixel of the MaskGroup node bounding rectangle. The figure below illustrates that case. On the right is a MaskGroup node that contains a Poster node. In the center is an alpha bitmap with the same size as the Poster node. On the right is the result of rendering the MaskGroup node with the image in the center used as a mask.\nmaskExample1\nThe maskSize and maskOffset field values can be used to scale and offset the mask bitmap relative to the group coordinate system, as shown in the figure below. The mask is the same bitmap as in the figure above. In the below figure, the maskOffset field value has been set to (50, 30), offsetting the origin of the mask bitmap coordinate system relative to the origin of the MaskGroup node coordinate system 50 pixels to the left and 30 pixels down.The maskSize field value has been set to (100, 50), This causes the width of the mask bitmap to be scaled from 150 to 100, and the height of the mask bitmap to be scaled from 80 to 50, so that the mask right edge aligns with the right edge of the MaskGroup node bounding rectangle, and the mask bottom edge aligns with the bottom edge of the MaskGroup node bounding rectangle. The center of the figure shows the mask with the maskOffset and maskSize field values applied overlaid on top of the MaskGroup node. The right side of the figure shows the result of applying the mask to the MaskGroup node. Notice that the left column of pixels in the mask is used as the mask for all columns of the MaskGroup node that lie to the left of the mask, causing those columns to be rendered with full opacity. Similarly, and the top row of the mask is used as the mask for all rows of the MaskGroup node that lie above the mask, causing each of the rows to fade out on the right.\nmaskExample2\nAs shown in above, the transformed mask may not overlay all the rendered pixels of the MaskGroup node. In that case, the leftmost (rightmost) columns of the mask bitmap are used as the mask for any MaskGroup node pixels that are to the left (right) of the transformed mask. The top (bottom) row of the mask bitmap is used as the mask for MaskGroup node pixels that are above (below) the transformed mask.",

Similarly, the bitmaps used for the icon and background can be specified for both focused and unfocused button states.\nBy default, the background of the button is only shown when the button has the key focus. Buttons are typically used in a ButtonGroup node that manages which button in the group will have the key focus when the ButtonGroup node receives the focus. When the ButtonGroup node has the focus, the button in the group that has the focus will display the focusBitmapUri bitmap as its background. When the ButtonGroup node does not have the focus, it remembers which button in the group had the focus and sets that button showFocusFootprint field to true, causing it to a render a \"footprint\" bitmap as a visual indicator that it will be the focused button when the ButtonGroup node receives the focus again. All other buttons in the ButtonGroup node do not display a background image.\nWhen a Button node is created that is not a child of a ButtonGroup node, typically the showFootprintfield field should be set to true, so that the button always displays a background image.",

            "description": "The ColorFieldInterpolator node class specifies a keyframe animation sequence to be applied to the color field of a node (such as the color field of a Label node).\nAll field interpolators include a set of key/keyValue field pairs that define a keyframe of the animation. Field interpolators are generally used as children of an Animation node. As the animation progresses, it sets the fraction field of its field interpolators to a value between 0 and 1, indicating the fraction of the animation progress. The keyframe fields of the interpolator are key, the percentage where the keyframe should occur, and keyValue, the value that the field should have at that fraction of the animation.\nFor example, if a ColorFieldInterpolator node had three keyframes:\n0.0, 0xFF0000FF (red)\n\n0.4, 0x00FF00FF (green)\n\n1.0, 0x0000FFFF (blue)\nWhen the interpolator fraction field value was 0.0 (that is, 0%), the color field value would be set to red. When the fraction field value was 0.4 (that is, 40%), the color field value would be set to green. When the fraction field value was 1.0 (that is, 100%), the color field value would be set to blue.\nFor values of the fraction field between 0.0 and 0.4 (such as 0.2 or 20%), the field value is determined by linearly interpolating the keyValue field values for the first two keyframes. In this case, since the key of 0.2 is halfway between the key at 0.0 and the key at 0.4, the field would be set to a color halfway between red and green. Similarly, when the fraction field value is between the second and third keys (that is, between 0.4 and 1.0), the field value is determined by linearly interpolating the keyValue field values of the second and third keyframes.\nIf the first keyframe has a key field fraction value greater than zero, then the field value is equal to the keyValue field value of the first keyframe until the fraction field value reaches the first keyframe key field fraction value. Similarly, if the last keyframe has a key field fraction value less than one, the color field value is set to the keyValue field value of the last keyframe, from when the fraction field value equals the last keyframe key field fraction value percentage, and will not change as the fraction field value increases from that value to 1.0.\nThe ColorFieldInterpolator node class works in the HSV color space. Doing the interpolation in the HSV color space produces the most intuitive, visually pleasing results when animating color values.\nWhile linear interpolation is used to compute the keyValue field values for fraction field values between successive keys, non-linear easing functions may be applied to the fraction field values computed by the Animation node, so the overall animation may vary in speed.",

An instance of the XML component is used to display the data for each item in the grid data model. The appearance of the grid item as it enters/exits the grid focus position can be customized using scripting. SimpleMarkupList.zip is a sample channel containing a MarkupGrid where each item is an instance of an XML component. See the section MarkupGrid XML component for details.\nThe number of columns in the MarkupGrid node is fixed and the number of rows varies as needed to display all of the items in the grid data model. The items in the grid fill each row from left to right, then top to bottom. For example, if the grid data contains 8 items and the number of columns is set to 3, then items 1, 2 and 3 will be in the first row. Items 4, 5 and 6 will be in the second row. The third row will contain items 7 and 8 in the leftmost two columns and blank space in the right column.\nThe layout of rows and columns in the grid is very flexible. Possible layouts include:\na simple layout with all items in the grid having the same size\n\na layout with the items in some rows having varying heights and/or the items in some columns having varying widths\n\na layout with varying width rows and columns and items that occupy one or more rows and columns\nThe grid items can be organized into sections that are demarcated by labelled horizontal divider lines between the sections.",

The PanelSet node manages the position of a set of child Panel nodes, and implements the left and right panel sliding behavior. Once a Panel node has been added to a PanelSet node, it remains a child of the PanelSet node unless it is replaced by another Panel node, or slides completely off the right side of the screen.\nThe PanelSet node is designed to display two Panel nodes in most cases, one Panel node on the left and one on the right. When the PanelSet node has focus, and the user presses the Left (or Back) or Right remote control key, the panels slide to the left or right one position.\nFor example, suppose the PanelSet node has two Panel nodes as children, panel A and panel B. When the user presses the Right key, a new panel, panel C, should be created and added as a child of the PanelSet node. Adding a panel as a child of the PanelSet node causes all the panels to slide left one position, so that panel A is now offscreen to the left, panel B is in the left position, and panel C is in the right position. If the user presses the Right key again, a new panel, panel D, should be created and added as a child node of the PanelSet node. Adding panel D causes the panels to slide left again so that panels A and B are offscreen to the left, panel C is in the left position, and panel D is in the right position.\nAt this point, if the user presses the Left key (or Back key), the panels will slide one position to the right, back towards the original home position, so panel D will slide offscreen to the right, panel C will slide to the right position, and panel B will slide to the left position (panel A is still offscreen to the left). When the sliding animation ends, since panel D is offscreen to the right, it is automatically removed as a child node of the PanelSet node.",

The keyframes of the interpolator include a \"key\", the percentage where the keyframe should occur, and a \"keyValue\", the value that the field should have at that percentage.\nFor example, if a Vector2DFieldInterpolator had three keyframes, (0.0, 0.0, 0.0), (0.4, 500.0, 0.0) and (1.0, 500, 200.0), then when the interpolator's fraction field was 0.0 (i.e. 0%), the field would be set to 0.0, 0.0. When fraction was 0.4 (i.e. 40%), the field would be set to 500.0, 0.0. When fraction was 1.0 (i.e. 100%), the field would be set to 500.0, 200.0.\nFor values of fraction between 0.0 and 0.4 (e.g. 0.2 or 20%), the field value is determined by linearly interpolating the keyValues for the first two keyframes. In this case, since the key of 0.2 is halfway between the key at 0.0 and the key at 0.4, the field would be set to 250.0, 0.0 (halfway between the point 0.0, 0.0 and 200.0, 0.0. Similarly, when fraction is between the second and third keys (i.e. between 0.4 and 1.0), the field value is determined by linearly interpolating the keyValues of the second and third keyframes.\nFor this example, if the field being interpolated were the translation field of a Poster node parented to the Scene node, the Poster would originally be positioned with its top/left corner at the upper, left corner of the screen. As the animation proceeded from 0% to 40% complete, the Poster would slide horizontally to the right until it's top/left corner was at x=500.0, y=0.0. As the animation continued from 40% to 100% complete, the Poster would slide vertically down until its top/left corner was at x=500.0, y=200.0.\nIf the first keyframe has a key percentage greater than zero, then the field value will be equal to the keyValue of the first keyframe until fraction reaches the first keyframe's key percentage. Similarly, if the last keyframe has a key percentage less than one, the field value will be set to the keyValue of the last keyframe from when fraction equals the the last keyframe's key percentage and will not change as fraction increases from that value to 1.0.\nWhile linearly interpolation is used to compute the keyValue's for fraction values between successive keys, non-linear easing functions may be applied to the fraction values computed by the Animation node, so the overall animation may vary in speed.",

The field is set to an AA with two numeric-valued keys — width and height — as well as a string value indicating the current design resolution (\"HD\", \"FHD\" or \"SD\"). ${currentDesignResolutionCode}",
